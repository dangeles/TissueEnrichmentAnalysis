Experienced users will want to skip this and go straight to **Calling TEA**. However, this tutorial is by no means a complete introduction to Python or Pandas - in fact, it's more like a super fast crash course. I apologize for this, and in the future I will consider improving the tutorial.\n",

    "### What is TEA meant for? \n",
    "\n",
    "TEA is meant to provide straightforward analysis of large gene lists for *C. elegans* researchers.\n",
    "We hope that TEA will function as a hypothesis generator, or alternatively, as a way of understanding the biology behind a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is TEA different from GO?\n",
    "Great question. GO is primarily a molecular/cellular ontology, whereas TEA works from TO, the *C. elegans* tissue ontology. I believe tissues are, in some senses, fundamental units in biology. Often, it is the case that tissues, not cells, have been studied for considerably longer time, and as a result we have a better intuition for what the function of a tissue is, as compared to the molecular function of a list of genes. In other words, I think GO analysis and TEA are similar, but my guess is that the results from TEA will be easier to interpret, and as a result easier to use for hypotheiss generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What TEA is not:\n",
    "TEA is NOT meant to be used as a quantitative tool! \n",
    "\n",
    "At best, TEA is a very good guess about what tissues are being affected in your dataset. At worst, TEA is a guess about what tissues are being affected in your dataset. TEA is working directly from the WormBase-curated expression dataset. As a result, we have the very best, most up to date annotations in the world. On the other hand, please remember these annotations suffer from bias. For example, the ASE, ASK and ASI neurons have been very well studied and are quite well annotated, but the individual intestinal cells have not been generally well studied! Thus, our annotations are significantly biased by the research community's interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please use TEA carefully, and always use it as a guiding tool for your research, and never as the final say on anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do you need to do to run this tool?\n",
    "The gist of the algorithm is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Get your gene list into WBIDs\n",
    "\n",
    "Call our analysis function\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the plotting function\n",
